 # Description
 GitHub profile is an extremely important aspect of our public identity as a developer. A well crafted one allows to show off our work to other developers as well as future employers or clients. One important component of GitHub profile is a ReadMe.md file. This application enables a developer to make high quality ReadMe file fast and efficiently for every repository/ project. This was a great learning experience. Getting to learn Inquirer and fs was great. At the end getting to first learn about licenses and later to include their links, badges and to be able to provide and include them as choices was challenging. But I was able to overcome all that by learning them step by step.
