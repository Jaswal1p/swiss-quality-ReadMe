  # Description
  You could have also written the function without the right-hand side assignment. However, if you leave out the right-hand side assignment, the function will look for at least one argument to be supplied when invoked, whereas in its current form, you can call drawChart() without supplying any parameters. The current design is useful if you want to be able to call the function without supplying any parameters. The other can be useful when you want to ensure an object is passed to the function.
