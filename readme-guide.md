# ReadMe.MD: My description of project.

## Description 

This was a great learning experience to start making program/readme file straight from node.js and without using any browser and html/css that I just learned. It was not intuitive in the begining but with reading lessons and watching class videos, i figured out how to use inquirer from npm and also used fs. slowly things started making sense and i was able to capture the user input. Then came the challenge to create function to display all this data, which i slowly learned and figured out. Licenese and badges created another layer of challenges, as it needed three separate functions and to combine them in a sequential manner to one function and then put it strategically into the final generate function. Final skill learned is screencastify video generation and getting its link to display in the readme page.
